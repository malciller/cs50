## Description
My journey began as an entry-level call center agent, and through sheer stubborness and ChatGPT, I transitioned into a professional programmer. The acceleration in learning and applying new concepts was staggering. However, as my proficiency grew, the message cap on GPT-4 for ChatGPT Plus became a bottleneck in my professional development.

This application aims to fulfill two primary objectives:
1. **Data Collection for AI Training:** As I aspire to become a machine learning engineer, this platform will act as a repository for conversational AI training data.
2. **Extended ChatGPT Interface:** To offer a familiar ChatGPT-like interface for users who need more than the capped ChatGPT messages and are willing to cover the API usage costs.

**Privacy Commitment:** All personal information is confidential, will never be shared or sold, and users can delete their data at any time. Chat records, devoid of any personal identifiers, may contribute to the training dataset for future AI models.
